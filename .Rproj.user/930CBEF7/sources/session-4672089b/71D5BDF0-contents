During my last Master's semester I did an internship at a Flemish history and archaeology museum. The museum wanted to change their ticketing system, and it was my task to advice them on their choice. My project consisted of 5 steps:

1. Getting to know the museum and their ticketing software.

2. Researching alternatives to the ticketing software.

3. Quantitative research: survey of other museums.

4. Qualitative research: in depth interviews of other museums.
 
5. Presenting results to the museum director and board members.


I collected the data about museums in Belgium and the Netherlands with similar profiles to my target museums, and looked at the proportion if e-tickeing softwares they use.

Then, I looked at whether the choice of software has something to do with the annual visitor numbers, which could be a crucial deciding factor.

It is also essential to just simply have an overview of the dynamics of visitor numbers, regardless of the software they ar using.

And then also taking the softwares into account, which could signal that using a certain software can potentially boost or reduce visitor numbers.

This was followed by conducting interviews with 5 museums. The focus of the interviews to fins out the advantages and disadvantages of the current e-ticket systems these other museums were using, and compare their future plans and views on the industry. Additional information was gained about the organisational, process and technology factors of the software implementation, which served as a base material for my Master's Thesis, which you can find attacked.
